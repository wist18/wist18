# Short info about me

Hello, there! My name is Razvan and I am a motivated second year Bachelor Computer Science student (Honours). I have opted to study the research-oriented Honours track, and as a result, I am working on a research paper related to improving the scalability of Minecraft-like games. I like doing side projects related to programming topics that have been innovative around the time Internet was questionable to be successful (say anything from a Bash-like Shell, a FAT-16 Filesystem, Tetris and anything in between). I also like playing chess, but experience and a 50% win/lose rate has shown that I should better stick to programming as a career.

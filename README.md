# Short info about me

Hello, there! My name is Razvan and I am a motivated third year Bachelor Computer Science student (Honours). I have an interest for low-level programming and security vulnerabilities, and I am currently conducting a research paper related to how custom-made control policies can be used to address the scalability issues that Minecraft-like games present. I like doing side projects related to programming topics that have been innovative around the time Internet was questionable to be successful (say anything from a Bash-like Shell, a FAT-16 Filesystem, Tetris and anything in between). I also like playing chess, but experience and a 50% win/lose rate has shown that I should better stick to programming as a career.

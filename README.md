# Short info about me

Hello, there! My name is Razvan, and I am a passionate first-year Master's student specializing in Cybersecurity at Ã‰cole Polytechnique in France. Before starting my graduate studies, I have completed a Bachelor degree in Computer Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities starting late March 2025, where I can apply my skills and knowledge in a real-world setting. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with industry professionals, and further develop my expertise in software engineering or cybersecurity.

If you have an opening, I would love to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Feel free to reach out to me for networking, collaboration, or potential internship opportunities.
